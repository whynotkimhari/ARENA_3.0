        "You should have some variable `mat` which is a batch of matrices, i.e. it has shape `(n_rays, n_segments, 2, 2)`. You can then define `is_singular` as a boolean tensor of shape `(n_rays, n_segments)` which is true wherever the matrix is singular. Now, indexing `mat[is_singular]` returns a tensor of shape `(N, 2, 2)` where the `[i, :, :]`-th element is the `i`-th singular matrix. Thanks to broadcasting rules, you can set `mat[is_singular] = t.eye(2)`, and the identity matrix with shape `(2, 2)` will get broadcasted to the left hand shape `(N, 2, 2)`.\n",

There are situations where it's valuable for you to think about a problem for a while before moving forward because that deliberation will directly lead to you becoming a better researcher or engineer (e.g. when you're thinking of a hypothesis for how a circuit works while doing mechanistic interpretability on a transformer, or you're pondering which datastructure best fits your use case while implementing some RL algorithm). But there are also situations (like this one) where you'll get more value from speedrunning towards an understanding of certain code or concepts, and apply your understanding in subsequent exercises. It's important to find a balance!\n",

        "GPT-3.5 and 4 both have advantages and disadvantages in different situations. GPT-3.5 has a large advantage in speed over GPT-4, and works equally well on simple problems or functions. If it's anything that Copilot is capable of writing, then you're likely better off using it instead of GPT-4.\n",

        "#### Additional notes on using GPT (from Joseph Bloom)\n",
        "\n",
        "* ChatGPT is overly friendly. If you give it bad code it won't tell you it's shit so you need to encourage it to give feedback and/or show you examples of great code. Especially for beginner coders using it, it's important to realise how *under* critical it is.\n",
        "* GPT is great at writing tests (asking it to write a test for a function is often better than asking it if a function is correct), refactoring code (identifying repeated tasks and extracting them) and naming variables well. These are specific things worth doing a few times to see how useful they can be.\n",
        "* GPT-4 does well with whole modules/scripts so don't hesitate to add those. When you start managing repos on GitHub, use tracked files so that when you copy-paste edited code back, all the changes are highlighted for you as if you'd made them. (VSCode highlights changes with small blue bars next to the line numbers in your python files.)\n",
        "\n",
        "Here are some things you can play around with:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Ask GPT it to write tests for the function. You can give more specific instructions (e.g. asking it to use / not to use the `unittests` library, or to print more informative error messages).\n",

Before you run your debugger, you can set breakpoints by clicking on the left-hand side of the line number (a red dot will appear). You can then step through your code, using the toolbar of buttons which will appear when you run the debugger (see [here](https://pawelgrzybek.com/continue-step-over-step-into-and-step-out-actions-in-visual-studio-code-debugger-explained/) for an explanation of what each of the buttons does). When you reach a breakpoint, you can use the following tools:\n",

Note that this method returns a copy of the tensor rather than the tensor itself (unless the `to` command doesn't change its device).

        "To wrap up today, we're going to have a further discussion of **testing**. So far, our test functions have been pretty simple - we imported a test from the `part1_ray_tracing/tests.py` file, and ran it to compare our answers to the answers in `part1_ray_tracing/solutions.py`. This works perfectly fine, but there are other Python libraries which can make testing easier and more powerful. In particular, two such libraries are `unittest` and `pytest`. Both these libraries provide extensive features for modularizing and running test functions, and have nice integrations with VSCode. `unittest` is very powerful, but also has a steep learning curve and isn't worth the trouble of learning during a 6 week course. However, `pytest` is very useful and easy to learn, so we'll spend some time here discussing it.\n",
        "\n",
        "The pytest framework makes it easy to write small, readable tests, and can scale to support complex functional testing for applications and libraries. Today we'll just discuss a few features which will be particularly useful for the kinds of tests we'll be writing, but you're welcome to explore more tests later on.\n",
        "\n",
        "*Important note - if you're working on Colab or a notebook for these exercises, your tests won't work, because in this setup we'll be importing answers from our test file, rather than importing tests from our answers file. For this reason, we won't be using pytest for the structured exercises in this course (in case anybody is following these exercises in a notebook), but you're strongly recommended to use pytest when you're working from `.py` files instead - which is strongly recommended during much of the bonus content.*\n",
        "\n",
        "First, look at `part1_ray_tracing/tests.py`. The tests in this file all follow a similar pattern: evaluate your function on some input, check it equals the solution. This is a clear sign that we can use modularization to simplify our code! Compare this file to `part1_ray_tracing/test_with_pytest.py`, which contains the same tests but refactored using pytest. The latter is clearly separated into three sections: one for library imports, one for defining the inputs we'll use for our test functions, and one where we define our test functions.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Parametrization\n",
        "\n",
        "We use `pytest.mark.parametrize` to parametrize our tests. This means we can run the same test a bunch of different times on different inputs. In the non-pytest version, we did this by defining different functions (e.g. `test_intersect_ray_1d` and `test_intersect_ray_1d_special_case`), but this isn't necessary here.\n",
        "\n",
        "The syntax of a function decorated by `pytest.mark.parametrize` is:\n",

        "    (val4, val5, val6),\n",

        "\n",
        "### How to run these tests?\n",
        "\n",
        "There are three ways to run the above tests:\n",

        "1. **From the terminal**\n",
        "\n",
        "You can run them from the command line using the pytest command. Open your terminal in VSCode at the bottom of the screen, make sure you're in the directory `chapter0_fundamentals`, then enter the command `pytest`. This will search the current directory (or subdirectories) for any python files with the prefix `test_`, and within that file run all functions with the prefix `test_` (i.e. all the tests for these exercises).\n",
        "\n",
        "You can also add more complicated commands, like:\n",
        "\n",
        "* `pytest test_intersect_ray_1d` to specify the file to run tests from\n",
        "* `pytest test_intersect_ray_1d::test_intersect_ray_1d` to specify the file and test function\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **From your Python file**\n",
        "\n",
        "To do this, you need to call `pytest.main` (make sure this is wrapped in an `if MAIN` block). The first argument of this function is a list of args to `pytest`. This has analogous syntax to the command line option, for instance here are a few ways you can do this:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "pytest.main([])\n",
        "pytest.main([\"test_part1_ray_tracing.py\"])\n",
        "pytest.main([\"test_part1_ray_tracing.py::test_intersect_ray_1d\"])\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **From VSCode's testing display**\n",
        "\n",
        "This is by far the most useful way to run test functions. VSCode provides a helpful interface to run all test functions in your directory, and see which of them have passed. First, press the test icon on the left hand sidebar (it will look like a triangular flask). If this is your first time, then you'll need to click on the **Configure Python Tests** button, then select `pytest` as your framework (you may have to install pytest when prompted). This should automatically perform test discovery for you, showing you all the test files & functions in your current directory in the left hand window (it detects this the same way pytest does, using the `test_` prefix). You can hover over tests or files to see options like \"run test(s)\" or debug test(s)\". When you run them, you'll see a tick or cross appear next to the test, indicating whether it passed or failed.\n",
        "\n",
