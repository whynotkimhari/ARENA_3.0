You'll also implement the backwards versions of some basic functions: if we have tensors `output = func(input)`, then the backward function of `func` can calculate the grad of `input` as a function of the grad of `output`.\n",

In order to find the `grad` of each tensor in a computational graph, we first have to perform a **topological sort** of the tensors in the graph, so that each time we try to calculate `tensor.grad`, we've already computed all the other gradients which are used in this calculation. We end this section by writing a `backprop` function, which works just like the `tensor.backward()` method you're already used to in PyTorch.\n",

        "\n",
        "In this section, we build your own equivalents of `torch.nn` features like `nn.Parameter`, `nn.Module`, and `nn.Linear`. We can then use these to build our own neural network to classify MINST data.\n",

We've discussed it in earlier exercises, but we're reviewing it here because it's very important for backprop. If you're comfortable with the topic, feel free to jump forwards to the section \"Why do we need broadcasting for backprop?\".\n",

        "Both NumPy and PyTorch have the same rules for broadcasting. When two tensors are involved in an elementwise operation, NumPy/PyTorch tries to broadcast them (i.e. copying them along dimensions) so that they both have the same shape. The rules of broadcasting are as follows:\n",

        "1. You can prepend dummy dimensions (of size 1) to the start of a tensor until both have the same number of dimensions\n",
        "2. After this point, if some dimension has size 1 in one of the tensors, it can be repeated until it matches the size of the corresponding dimension in the other tensor\n",
        "\n",
        "To give a simple example - suppose we have a 2D batch of data, of shape `data.shape = (N, k)` (i.e. we have `N` separate datapoints, each being a vector of length `k`). Suppose we want to add a vector `vec` of length `k` to each datapoint. This is a valid operation, because when we try and add these two objects together:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. `vec` gets prepended with a dummy dimension so it has shape `(1, k)` and both are 2D\n",

So when we change some element of `x`, this causes a first-order change in the loss from all of these different pathways, and we have to sum these changes to get the total first-order change (i.e. the derivative).

We've so far assumed that the final node `L` in the computational graph is a scalar, and all gradients (i.e. the `grad_out` input to our backward functions and the output of our backward functions) are gradients of `L`. In this case, it would make sense to set `grad_out = [1]` for the first backward function call, since we're computing $\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial L} = 1$. But what about cases like the one above, when our final node `g` might not be a scalar?\n",

This is called the **directional derivative**. We then compute all tensor gradients using `L` as our final node. For example, this means that in our first gradient calculation (where `g` is the output and `f` is the input) we'll use `grad_out = dL/dg = v`. You don't really need to worry about this, because most of the time (including in the exercise below) we'll just be using the default behaviour where `v` is a tensor of 1s - this is equivalent to `L = g.sum()`."

Here, the `end_grad` argument you pass to `backward` gives you the option to override this default behaviour, in other words if it's supplied you should use it as the first input to your backward function instead of a tensor of 1s.

This is because a broadcast operation effectively copies our tensor, giving it more gradient paths that we need to sum over. Similarly, the backwards operation for summing is broadcasting. We can intuitively see this as follows: if we have some value `L = L(x_summed)` where `x_summed` is the result of summing `x` over some number of dimensions, then editing `x_summed[i, j, ...] += delta` has the same downstream effect as editing any one of the `x` values which were summed over to get `x_summed[i, j, ...]`.

Note that we did discuss earlier how inplace operations are very risky for backprop, this is generally true however here we're using it for parameter updates which aren't meant to be differentiated and which are performed just before zeroing all gradients - this makes it safe in this particular context."
